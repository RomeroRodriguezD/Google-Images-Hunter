mylist = searcher.scrap(concept='clown', download_url_lists=True, max_images=250, loadmore=20)

ImageDownloader(mylist, path='downloadtest/clowns/')
```

## Contributing

This is just an scraper I built since I have not been able to find the exact kind of Google images scraper I was looking for. I made it mixing my own ideas and some features I cherrypicked from different scraping scripts I found during my research task. Thanks to those anonymous contributors.

Pull requests are welcome. For changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. Notice that this is the first version, currently tested on Firefox, so although it should
work regularly on Chrome and Edge, it still needs more tests.
